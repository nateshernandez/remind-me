# Render states

Turn each stub into a case that renders, and assert what a reviewer would say out loud about it. The board goes from red to green as they land, and the green board is what product signs.

Read `docs/agents/redspec.md` for the paths. Call the Skill tool with "falsifiable-specs" for what promotion means.

Steps 1, 2 and 5 are **HITL**.

## Process

### 1. Read the skeleton back

`redspec status`. The _declared_ list is your work list. Read it to the user before building: they are checking that the skeleton still describes the feature they meant.

### 2. Say where the design comes from

Either the repo already answers it — a presentational layer, an app shell, a token set; name what you reuse — or the surface has no precedent here, in which case generate structurally different variants (the `prototype` skill, if available) and come back with the winner. Never decide this silently.

### 3. Render each declared state

```
redspec new state STATE-<slug>-<case>
```

This scaffolds the fixture, the sketch, the assertion, and prints the `cases` entry to add. Fixtures are plain data — a case that reaches for the network is a Journey wearing a State's clothes. Build for the configured viewport (1280×720 by default).

**Every user-facing string goes through `copy.ts`.** The sketch renders `copy["COPY-…"]`; the assertion asserts against the same constant. A hardcoded string in a sketch is a finding.

### 4. Assert each state

One behavioural assertion per case, named for its ID, in **user intent**: that the empty state offers the action that fills it, that the error names a way forward, that the read-only case shows no control that lies about being usable. No selector, class, or coordinate — those describe the sketch and break on promotion. Plus one `toHaveScreenshot`.

**The title after the ID is what the board draws under the state**, as its _Then_, beside the row's situation and the label that led there. Write it as the sentence a reviewer would say out loud, because that is who reads it.

Journey specs in `e2e/journey/<slug>.spec.ts` are generated from the flows by `redspec new journeys <slug>`, one per reachable path, and stay `test.fixme` until the slice that claims the flow lands. Do not hand-write them.

### 5. Review the board, then hunt what it missed

`redspec board`. Walk the flows view lane by lane and the surfaces view waiver by waiver. A copy fix lands in `copy.ts` and nowhere else.

Then dispatch the `spec-adversary` agent. Work every finding: build the state, place it on a flow, or record in the Brief why it does not apply.

## Done when

`redspec status` shows no _declared_ findings for this feature and `pnpm test:state` passes. Every case is fixture-driven. No assertion names a selector. Every string is a `COPY-`. Where the design came from was stated, and the user answered.

Then clear the window and run `/implement-rules`.
